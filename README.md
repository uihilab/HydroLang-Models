## Introduction
HydroLang-Models is created for the users of [HydroLang](https://github.com/uihilab/HydroLang) to share their models, codes, and case studies to enable others to browse and build on top of, and thus creating a community. HydroLang, along with HydroLang-Models, are published on GitHub with MIT License available for use by the academics and professionals of the water domain all around the world.

## Community Resources
### Models
HydroLang users are encouraged to build and share predictive models suitable for hydrological use cases. Models can be uploaded into the respective hydrological subdomain's folder along with a brief description. 

* **Evapotranspiration**
* **Groundwater**
* **Hazards**
* **Precipitation**
* **Runoff**
* **Snow**
* **Soil Moisture**
* **Water Quality**
* **Other**

Models can be developed in HydroLang through two ways:
* The native API.
* BMI specification steering files.
* HTML driven applications.

Please refer to the [models page](https://github.com/uihilab/HydroLang-Models/tree/main/models) for more information.

### Data
HydroLang allows users to retrieve, filter, process, and combine hydrological data from a variety of resources. Under this folder, the users can share their data retrieval scripts for future utilization and reference.

### Case Studies
One of the main goals of HydroLang is to simplify hydrological data retrieval, analysis, visualization, modeling, and mapping with readable, concise, and contained code, thanks to its comprehensive and modular design. HydroLang users can share their case study scripts for reproduction, modification, and feedback collection.
