# Case Studies
Please include any case study that falls within the scope of environmental/hydrological sciences that uses HydroLang. This represents both, studies that have already been carried out using the framework, or ideas that can be developed by others or the developers.

Users can tailor their case studies in whichever format they see fit. We do recommend, however, that the models use the instructions outlined in the [models page](https://github.com/uihilab/HydroLang-Models/tree/main/models).

## What to Include
Each case study should have a .txt, .md, or any rich text format with minimum the following items:
* Few lines describing the scope of the research.
* Referenced or published papers and manuscripts if available/applicable.
* Functions used from the framework.
* Results

If using publicly available data retrieved using the framework, please mention what were the query parameters and data sources used for the study.
